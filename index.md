Our core competencies, role descriptions, practices and methodologies for DID(it) enterprise software development success

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to have a centralized, easily-sharable location for the practices that we love
@ DID(it) to live and serve as a reference point for other development teams.

### Sections
- Design
- Product Management
- Engineering

### Approach
  
Each section within this project (see above for sections), includes their own page for members of those teams
to freely express their ideals and practices. All work should be done via GithHub Pull Requests, with a reviewer
(or pair) on each to make sure the content being published is both technically and gramatically accurate.

One should not feel pressure to contribute, but it would be awesome if you decide. It does not matter how
experienced, technical, or creative you are. Good ideas can come from anywhere, and what better way to collect
and share these than a forum like this.
