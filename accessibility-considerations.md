<h4 class="How" id="How">
How We Do It
</h4>
<ul>
<li>During solution design, the team should consider accessibiilty considerations when creating design alternatives</li>
<li>Consider the accessibility of data, for example:</li>
<ul>
<li>Is data audio-compatible, either directly or through a tooltip?</li>
<li>Is there sufficient color contrast between the background and text?</li>
<li>Is the text large enough to be read easily?</li>
<li>Can pages be navigated without the use of a mouse?</li>
<li>Are there visual focus indicators, such as outlines? Is data sequential?</li>
<li>Avoiding flickering and the presentation of data through images</li>
</ul>
<li>Put ourselves in the position of all users when evaluating solutions</li>
<li>All deployment candidates should undergo both automated and manual 508 inspection to verify compliance</li>
<li>All accessibility issues shall be logged and corrected prior to solution deployment</li>
</ul>
