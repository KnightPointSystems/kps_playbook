#### Understanding Front matter

Front matter is something that should be added to every page on this site. It is something that allows you
to utilize a lot of the power that Jekyll gives you. For reference, front matter is the content at the beginning
of our files that starts and ends with: `---`.

Everything between sets of `---` is called front matter, and this is where an infinite number of properties
can be defined that can be used programatically within our templates.

For example, if you would like to set the title and route of a markdown page you are writing, it could
look something like:

```
---
title: This is my title
permalink: /this/is/my/route
---
```
