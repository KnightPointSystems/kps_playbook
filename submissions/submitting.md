# Submissions
A playbook is a set of prescriptions for how to do work. Since DID(IT) is a culture that is defining itself, we want to capture the debate that is essential to developing those prescriptions. We will use the github mechanism of Pull Requests to accept submissions in the form of articles. Each is an argument for doing work in any of the areas of DID(IT) (Engineering) a certain way. Everyone in DID(IT) will have the opportunity to comment on each article, and a small group will be responsible for distilling the contents into pages of our playbook. The Pull Requests, and therefore all of the debate, remain within the source code of the playbook.

While we encourage substantive debate, we would like to avoid line-editing for grammar and/or style. We can review those aspects of content on the playbook pages themselves.

A sample submission is provided in Engineering.
