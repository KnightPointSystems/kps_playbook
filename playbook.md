<h2>Build - High Value and Low Effort (Pivot or Perservere)</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Pivot</h3>
<h4>Prototype </h4>
<ul>
<li>Group Sketching- Ideation or design studios to gather concepts </li>
<li>Design- creating low and high fidelity mock ups </li>
<li>Internal Validation- testing with team </li>
</ul>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<ul>
<li>Determining Test Focus- what do we need to know</li>
<li>Script Generation- what questions do we need to ask</li>
<li>Determine Participants- external validation, who do we want to interview and test with</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<h3>Persevere </h3>
<h4>Integration Planning Meeting </h4>
<ul>
<li>Story Cards- Stories Created and discussed as a team</li>
<li>Design Review- Mock up reviewed for context and understanding</li>
<li>Story Sized- Engineering Points Card base on complexity</li> 
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="dropdown-divider"></div>

<h2>Measure - Get Feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li>Interview- contextual interview or shadowing</li>
<li>Design Validation- mock up or UI testing</li> 
</ul>

<div class="dropdown-divider"></div>

<h2>Learn - Did We Get It Right or Do We Need to Iterate Again? (Pivot or Persevere)</h2>
<ul>

### Approach
  
Each section within this project (see above for sections), includes their own page for members of those teams
to freely express their ideals and practices. All work should be done via GithHub Pull Requests, with a reviewer
(or pair) on each to make sure the content being published is both technically and gramatically accurate.

One should not feel pressure to contribute, but it would be awesome if you decide. It does not matter how
experienced, technical, or creative you are. Good ideas can come from anywhere, and what better way to collect
and share these than a forum like this.
