description: De-risking refers to the method of adequately understanding each backlog story and identify potential risk that could arise during development. Having a team conversation about the highest priority and highest value backlog stories creates an environment where the members of the product team can collaborate on the solutions to business problems.
steps:
  - title: Schedule regular meetings
    text: Meetings are schedule weekly with the product team, whenever possible. The product manager grooms the backlog prior to the meeting.
  - title: Size each story

  - title: Identify risks
    text: The team discusses any potential risks found based on the severity of impact. Identify stories that are not defined well enough to be worked and need further clarification.
