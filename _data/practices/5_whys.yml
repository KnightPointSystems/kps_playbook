description: The 5 Whys is an analytical technique to help find the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.
steps:
  - title: Assemble the team
    text: Gather together people who are familiar with the detail of the problem. Assign a facilitator to keep the team focused.
  - title: Write down the specific problem
    text: Write the specific of the problem from the user’s perspective. Writing the issue helps you formalize the problem and describe it completely. It also helps a team focus on the same problem.
  - title: Ask why
    text: Ask Why the problem happens and write the answer down below the problem.
  - title: Repeat asking why
    text: If the answer you just provided does not identify the root cause of the initial problem that you wrote down in ask why again and write that answer down. Continue asking why until the team agrees that the problem’s root cause is identified. This may take fewer or more times than five whys.
