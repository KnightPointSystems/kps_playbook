  Usability testing is a method used to evaluate how well users can use a product. The tests take place with real users. They measure how ‘usable’ or ‘intuitive’ a product is and how easy it is for users to reach their goals. Users are asked to complete tasks, typically while they are being observed by a researcher, to see where they encounter problems and experience confusion.<br><br>
  There are different types of usability testing:<br><br>
  <b>Comparative usability testing</b> – Comparative tests are commonly used to compare the usability of a product against peer or competitor products. However, it can also be used to compare two designs to establish which provides the best user experience.<br><br>
  <b>Explorative usability testing</b> – Before a new product is released, explorative usability testing can establish what content and functionality a new product should include to meet the needs of its users. Users test a range of different services where they are given realistic scenarios to complete. helps to highlight any gaps in the market that can be taken advantage of and illustrate where to focus design effort.<br><br>
  <b>A/B testing</b> – In an A/B test, you are comparing A to B. You take a webpage or app screen and modify it to create a second version of the same page. This change can be as simple as a single headline or button, or be a complete redesign of the page. Then, half of your traffic is shown the original version of the page (known as the control) and half are shown the modified version of the page.<br>
steps:
  - title: Identify a group of users to test
    text: Include representatives from different roles so you can get multiple perspectives and possible problems. Introduce the concept of usability testing to the people not familiar with it.
  - title: Schedule testing sessions
    text: Usability testing can be scheduled via email introductions or through the product owner. Schedule in person meeting whenever possible. If the user is not able to meet in person, a remote meeting via Adobe Connect or Skype will do.
  - title: Collect your feedback
    text: Guide users through tasks and ask exploratory questions if needed. The designer or product manager lead the testing sessions.
  - title: The team takes notes
    text: During usability testing, have at least 2 to 3 other team members taking notes to record insights results. The more detailed the notes, the better. Use the notes to track feedback direct from users to focus the product team and avoid potential problems before the product is launched.
  - title: Compile notes
    text: The designer or product manager will compile the team's notes and then schedule a time for the team to discuss the insights from the testing.
