description: A prototype is worth a thousand words. Sometimes it is hard to describe an abstract idea. Use prototypes to describe your concepts more effectively. A prototype is a working concept built to evaluate the visual and functional aspects of the intended design. It is generally used to refine a concept, gather early feedback, and iterate to make your product better.
steps:
  - title: Pick a tool that fits your needs
    text: For designers, it can be a mixture of sketches, wireframes and mockups. For developers, focus on conceptualizing your idea using a simple framework.
  - title: Transform a concept into reality
    text: Give yourself permission to experiment. Ask yourself, “What if?”. Be creative and enjoy the process of building your concept.
  - title: Evolve your concept
    text: A prototype starts with the basic functions and proceeds with a higher-fidelity and fully-interactive concept that looks and feels like the real product.
  - title: Test and refine your prototype
    text: As you test your prototype, you will find issues and challenges in your design. After receiving feedback, iterate to improve the design and solve any problems.
