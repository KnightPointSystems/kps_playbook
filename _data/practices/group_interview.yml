Groups can be constructed in deliberate ways to capture insights from different demographics of users.

  - title: Identify the group you want to interview
    text: Think through the type of users you want to hear from. Take into account the group’s make up Are they all of the same type of user or different types of users? Additionally, consider what you’re investigating. If it’s specific, form a group that you have the best opportunity to find more about what you’re looking for.
  - title: Have the group meet
    text: Find a space for the group to convene. The space needs to be on a neutral ground, such as a conference room, where all participants feel comfortable.
  - title: Conduct the interview
    text: Prior to the interview, designate one person to ask questions. Other team members will take notes and capture what the group is saying.
  - title: Engaging with the interviewees 
    text: As you’re conducting the interview, be sure mindful of the group dynamics. If some of the members of the group have been quiet, find ways to engage with them directly, such as by asking them questions or finding ways to quiet more active members of the group.
