description: In the framing process you focus on deepening your understanding of the cause of the problems identified in Discovery. In order to do this, you have to propose solutions that provide value to users, define success for our solutions and validate your proposed solutions. You do this to narrow the field of possible solutions to the highest value solutions and determine a clear product direction.
steps:
  - title: Define solutions as possibilities
    text: Rephrase the problems from the Problem Workshop as "How Might We" statements. Check each statement is broad enough to allow for multiple solutions, but not too broad to lose focus.
  - title: Find the root cause for each problem
    text: For each problem, apply the 5 whys technique. Build product team consensus around the root cause. Learn more about <a href="../5_whys">5 whys</a>.
  - title: Generate a wide range of solutions
    text: Use brainstorming and sketching techniques to explore innovative ways to solve the problems. Through these techniques, you will find you can build on the ideas of others. Learn more about <a href="../brainstorming">brainstorming </a> and <a href="../sketching">sketching </a>.
  - title: Prototype interviews
    text: Validate your assumptions using static or interactive prototypes. The best mark a feature can have is if its use is so obvious the user wonders why the interview is needed.

  - title: Keep your development priorities focused
