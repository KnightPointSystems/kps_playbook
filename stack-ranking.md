            How We Do It
        </h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Start with a group of synthesized problems or solutions</li>
			<ul><li>A good method is to first perform a 2x2 and then take all of the items from the upper right (most important) quadrant to stack rank</li></ul>
		<li>Taking one issue at a time solicit feedback from the participants and audience</li>
			<ul><li>Examples could be the Product Engineers providing insight into complexity or Product Stakeholders providing information on organization strategic vision</li></ul>
		<li>The Product Designer and Product Owner Team should decide where to place each issue in a single line from Most 	Important on top to Least Important at bottom</li>
			<ul><li>“Important” could also be replaced by other measures such as Valuable, Time-Sensitive, Complex, etc</li></ul>
		<li>Items <b>CANNOT</b> be tied. This is relative ranking so each item must be above or below another</li>
		<li>Once a single ordered list is agreed upon, the Product Team will add it to the backlog for discovery or implementation</li>
