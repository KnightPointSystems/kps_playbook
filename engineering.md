The engineers at DID(it) are a creative group that finds ways to develop solutions
using modern development technologies. This group involves everything from junior
developers, senior developers, devops engineers, to ops engineers; but all have
the same goals. To build great and stable products for our customers in a
conscious and innovative way. 

## Practices

* [Test-Driven Development]({{ site.baseurl }}/submissions/engineering/TDD)
* [DevOps Culture]() (TODO)
* [Pairing]() (TODO)

## Doc Submissions

A core practice of the engineering part of this playbook is submissions.
Submissions are a way where people can contribute and critique the content
that enters this playbook. This really gives our engineers the ability to
craft this the way we desire.

More information about these submissions and currently open submissions can
be found here: [Submissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/submissions)

## `Sample Code`

```ruby
class Greeting
  def self.hello
    'Hello Everyone!'
  end
end

Greeting.hello() # => 'Hello Everyone!'
```
