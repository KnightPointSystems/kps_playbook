           <li>To establish a shared agreement of the relative amount of work required to successfully implement a given story</li>

</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Regularly scheduled (~weekly) meetings held with the Product Team</li>
    <li>The Product Manager grooms the backlog prior to the meeting</li>
    <li>The Product Team agrees on a method for sizing in their initial sizing meeting
        <ul>
            <li>T-Shirt Sizing – XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL..</li>
            <li>Pointing – 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="IPS-Agrees" id="IPS-Agrees">The Product Team agrees on a baseline for their sizing
        <ul>
            <li>Example: an XS is roughly adding one field to one screen with validation and transaction logic</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Each larger “size” is roughly 2x the effort of the previous</li>
    <li>Sizing is NOT equal to time.  It is a relative measure of effort.</li>
    <li>The team takes a few minutes to discuss each user story in order of priority from the Kanban board</li>
    <li>The team votes on the relative size of the story</li>
    <li>Differences in sizing are discussed, and re-votes occur until the team agrees on a size</li>
    <li>If the team cannot reach consensus within a short amount of time the story should be tabled for further elaboration</li>
    <li>Stories which are sized larger than 8 points (XL) should be evaluated for further splitting whenever possible</li>
    <li>The goal is to have a backlog of stories that are 1 or 2 point stories</li>
