		<ul><li>Work with the team to define 3-5 subject areas (stations)</li>
		<ul><li>There should be at least one station for each subject area (Product, Design, Engineering) where they share what theyâ€™ve learned during discovery</li>
		<li>Additional stations could explore practices like user interviewing, pair programming, or test driven development</li></ul>
		<li>Setup the physical stations</li>
		<ul><li>Create visual elements like sticky notes from synthesis or low fidelity prototypes</li>
		<li>Use a large room to force people to move around</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Plan your presentation</li>
		<ul><li>Assign Product Team members to each station</li>
		<li>Make your content interactive so the participants engage with the material being presented</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Execution</li>
		<ul><li>Break the participants into small groups to match the number of stations</li>
		<li>Assign each group to a station to start</li>
		<li>Each group should spend 15-20 minutes at each station</li>
		<li>At the stations</li>
		<ul><li>Allow the participants at least 5 minutes to review the content</li>
		<li>The Product Team member should talk about the most important lessons from discovery, but keep it short</li>
		<li>Create a space for discussion and questions</li>
		<li>Rotate the groups to the next station and repeat</li>
