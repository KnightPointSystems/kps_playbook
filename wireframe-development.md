    How We Do It
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Using a tool like Balsamic quickly create low fidelity sketches</li>
    <li>These sketches should not look like working software but instead be black on white, hand drawn (or simulated) so users aren't overly focussed on details</li>
    <li>Use them to facilitate conversation and accelerate feedback loops on potential solutions</li>
