It's not about the technology of the service, but the value the service provides the business.”—Rebecca Jacoby, CIO, CISCO </li>

    How We Do It
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Product Manager composes a PowerPoint, based off of what business value metric was previously identified (Productivity, Efficiency, Quality Standards, or Operational Effectiveness)</li>
    <li>The PowerPoint is composed based off of the various ways that were determined  earlier in how to successfully measure success based on your identified business value.</li>
    <li>What are the best metrics that should be used to measure? Determine the business values to measure and measure them by Qualitative and Quantitative Measures</li>
        <ul><li>Examples of Quantitative Measures:</li><ul>
        <li>Time spent doing an activity</li>
        <li>How much is each user, using the system</li>
        <li>Time spent in the system</li>
        <li>Throughput of users</li>
        <li>Time it takes to find the information you are looking for</li></ul></ul>
    <li>Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)</li>
    <ul><li>When costs are easily identified, ROI can be calculated by taking the investment's estimated revenue and subtracting the investment's cost. The result is divided by the investment's cost and multiplied by 100. The end result is a percentage that shows the rate of return on the IT project.</li></ul>

Example – ROSS2 Application Business Value
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>$13,440 yearly savings through automation of the Asylum scheduling process. $3220 yearly savings for RAD through productivity improvements.</li>
    <li>Overview: ROSS is being upgraded from Cold Fusion to Ruby in order to improve efficiency and provide enhanced functionality. The user base is expanding to encompass Asylum and International Operations in addition to Refugee Affairs. A major pain point in the current application is the slowness of the scheduling engine. This slowness causes hours of lost productivity by ROSS users. The new application will improve the scheduling engine in addition to other functional enhancements.</li>
    <li>Manual Asylum scheduling  is currently taking up to a week each month through a manual process involving multiple databases, spreadsheets, and communications with other divisions</li>
    <ul><ul>
    <li>1 week a month = 480 hours a year x $35 an hour (GS-12 Step 5) = $16,800</li>
    </ul>
<li>If Asylum uses the new ROSS2 for scheduling circuit rides with RAD officers, we estimate they could reduce that burden to only one day a month for an 80% time savings.</li>
</ul>
<ul><ul>
<li>1 day a month = 96 hours a year x $35 = $3360</li>
</ul>
<li>This results in a $13,440 savings each year. Additional savings could be found if scheduling processes were improved and only occurred once per quarter.</li>
</ul>
<li>The Scheduling Engine currently takes 3 min per case to generate the list of available officers. The Scheduling Engine runs nearly 2 min every time a user attempts to view the circuit ride team composition.  In FY16, nearly 500 events were scheduled. If a user views that event only 5 times during the course of scheduling and editing, it adds up to 42 hours of time wasted waiting for the engine to run.</li>
<ul><ul>
<li>3 min x 500 cases = 1500 min = 25 hrs</li>
<li>2 min x 500 cases x 4 view = 4000 min = 67 hrs</li>
<li>92 hours x $35 an hour = $3220</li> 
</ul>
<li>Scheduling Engine inefficiencies are costing RAD over $3200 in lost productivity that the new application will resolve.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Calculate the metrics before development to the metrics after development</li>
<ul><li>Time spent on activity from start to finish before development; compared to time spent on activity from start to finish after development is complete</li>
<li>If the new Scheduler reduces the Scheduling Engine by 66% to 1 min, the time spent waiting would drop from 25 hours to 8 (1 min x 500 cases).</li>
<li>By not running the Scheduling Engine when a user views the circuit ride team competition, the 67 hours spent on waiting during the view/edit process would be reduced to just 32 min. </li>
</ul>
<li>These efficiency gains will result in $2922 in productivity improvements each year.</li>
<ul><li>8.5 hrs x $35 = $298</li>
<li>$3220 - $298 = $2922</li>
</ul></ul>
