## `ROLE DESCRIPTION`
* Creates a positive experience for the user
* Develops the overall look and feel of the product
* Gathers user requirements by developing contextual interview scripts and user testing hypothesis
* Consolidates results with the team to derive Insights and Actions which guide design of the product.
* Creates sketches, wireframes, mockups or prototypes
* Creates Journey maps, Storyboards or Service Blueprints
* Creates moodboards

## `PRACTICES` 
_**User Centered Design-Lean UX-Design Thinking**_
* Facilitates the rapid learning, ideation, prototyping and testing (Build, Measure, Learn)
* Facilitator for design sessions and ideation
* Brainstorming techniques for convergent and divergent thinking
* Mitigating UX decisions ie. style, look, feel, etc
* Testing methodologies, data collection and managing user feedback
* Assessabilit> y and Dis
ability standards

## `HOW` 
**_Build, Measure, Learn_**

### Discovery
* Meet with ITPM and necessary stakeholders to kickoff engagment (get baseline/MVP requirements) ITPM demo/review of current systems (issues and priorities)
    **Research and Investigate**
* Get usernames, passwords, URLs and permissions to the current system (stagging not production)
* Gather past user feedback on current system from ITPM
* Conduct a heuristics review of the workflows and UIs of the current system
* Work with ITPM to source the "KEY" end users/SMEs of the system their needs, requirements and preferences.

### Interviews
* Set up user interviews with a few people who fall under the persona you’re working with, for 1 hour each.
* Use Skype or Adobe Connect if remote.
* Consider using InVision to let the user review and add comments to your designs.
* Focus on the “why” to get to the root of the problems they are facing.
    **Synthesize Feedback**
* Conduct a synthesis of the user interviews, collecting insights and action items (usually product + design)
* Use the action items to guide you the rest of the week.
    **Prioritize Actions**
* Work as a team to determine if there are stories you feel confident are needed, and prioritize them based on the business value.

### User Story Review/Grooming
* Work with ITPM as they write user stories and prioritize in the backlog.
* upload your mock ups to the card or add links to InVision project page
    **Hold Planning/Grooming Meeting**
* Hold an Iteration Planning Meeting with the team to go through any new stories, discuss the complexity of stories and if stories need to be broken up further or combined
* Review mock ups with the team to paint the picture of what it might look like
    **Point Stories**
* Point the stories as a team.

### Prototype
* Prototype your ideas and changes. If you have a mockup or new functionality in staging, get feedback on those.
    **Solicit Ideas Internally**
* socialize the design concepts with your team, get their buy in and feedback on the design approach

### User Testing
**Determine test focus**
* Know the assumptions you are trying to validate. Put together a list of questions you would like to ask in the interviews. Pull together the necessary components or pages you will need to use in your test.

**Schedule New Interviews**
* Set up user interviews for the following week, based on your action items from this week (do you need to circle back to someone you previously spoke with, interview more users within the persona for a better understanding, or speak to someone with a different perspective (like management) for context?
