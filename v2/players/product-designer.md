                                The product designer role focuses on helping people find solutions to their problems and motivating interaction with the product. In order to gain confidence of the users, designers first focus on making the design efficient for people instead of the computer. The entire design process is iterative and requires continuous changes and refinements based on feedback from the customer and the product team.

Develop personas to represent the needs, behaviors and goals of different user types. Understand the tasks the users are trying to accomplish by determining the use cases. Focus on organizing, structuring, and labeling content using information architecture techniques. Journey maps can help you visualize the process the person goes through in order to accomplish their goals.</p>

                                    <p>Start your design with low-fidelity wireframes to define the outline and layout structure of the solution. As you progress in the design process, build mockups to experiment with visual hierarchy and interface elements. Once you understand the user interface, work in the visual aesthetics and usability of the product considering effects of color, shapes, typography and other visual elements. From this point, you can now move to design how the user will interact with the product and how the product response to userâ€™s input. During the interactive design, you can use prototypes to simulate the user interaction to the product.</p>

Through usability testing, you can learn how well users can achieve their goals successfully. Another method to test your solution is heuristic evaluation which compares your design against a list of established guidelines. Incorporate feedback from the user testing into changes to the product design.</p>
