                                A contextual inquiry is an interview method in which you observe user’s interaction with an application or work process. This method does not typically follow any script or formal agenda but rather a semi-structured approach. As a result, you are able to gather realistic data given a realistic user environment and scenario.

The goal initially is for you to gather information about the user’s task whilst establishing rapport. Made the user aware of the reasons for the interview as well as confidentiality. At this point a second team member can begin recording observations.</p>

Make the user aware of your intent to watch them work and learn how they do their job. Make the user aware that you may pause to ask them a question about their work.</p>
