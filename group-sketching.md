               <li>A product designer assembles product team members with knowledge of the problem to be solved</li>
		<li>Non-team members can provide valuable outside insights</li>
		<li>Participants sketch ideas about a problem, such as an application page, for a set amount of time (e.g. 5 minutes)</li>
		<li>At the end of the period, team members share their sketches with each other and discuss their process</li>
		<li>Participants discuss what they like from the sketches</li>
		<li>After a demonstration, the product designer begins another timed sketching session and repeats as many times as needed</li>
