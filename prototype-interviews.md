            What Are We Doing
        </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Allowing end users to interact with a static or interactive prototype of a feature</li>
		<li>Walking the user through the functions of a new feature, while asking questions and recording observations</li>

            Why We Do It
        </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To derive insights from how a user interacts with a design and their feelings about that interaction</li>
		<li>To render opinions on a feature before it is developed or released, in order to ensure that the product team is building the right thing for the end users</li>
		<li>To create short feedback loops and identify problems before a feature release or improve product quality</li>
	    </ul>

            How We Do It
        </h4>
            <ul>
               <li>The designer facilitates the interaction of the End Users with the prototype</li>
			<ul>
			    <li>It is important that the interview guide the user where possible, not direct them</li>
			    <li>The best mark a feature can have is if its use is so obvious the user wonders why the interview is needed</li>
			</ul>
		<li>The Product Designer and Product Manager track the feedback on an Assumptions Tracker</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Assumptions can be confirmed (Y), refuted (N), or not addressed/unable to decide (N/A)</li>
				<li>Verbatim quotes should be captures throughout the interview just like a contextual interview</li>
			</ul>
		<li>End users should be given time to discuss their overall impressions of the prototype, their experience, and any questions they may have at the end of the interview</li>
            </ul>
