                <li>To generate an early assessment of technical complexity</li>
		<li>To provide inside into technical challenges for the Product Owner Team and Product Stakeholders</li>
		<li>To enable prioritization based on the principle of tackling the most technical difficult highest value problem first</li>

            How We Do It
        </h4>
            <ul>
               	<li>Start with a group of synthesized problems</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Perform a 2x2 and then take all of the items from the upper right (most important) quadrant</li>
			</ul>
		<li>The Product Engineers should take a short time (5-10 minutes) to discuss the problem set</li>
		<li>The Product Engineers then present each problem to the Audience with a short explanation of their understanding and analysis of the problem</li>
		<li>The Product Engineers should assign a size to the problem (S-M-L-XL or 1-2-3-5-8). This reinforces the sizing that will be done in the future</li>
		<li>Once the sizing is complete, the Product Manager and Product Owner Team should incorporate the sizing and assessment into a final prioritization exercise to determine the problems to be solved</li>
