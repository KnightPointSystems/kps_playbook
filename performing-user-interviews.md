            How We Do It
        </h4>
	<ul>
        	<li>The business identifies a group of users.</li>
		<li>The user group, should include representatives from different groups and/or roles so that we can get various perspectives of what is inferred as the problem. </li>
		<li>User interviews can be scheduled via email introductions or through the business representative.</li>
		<li>User interviews should be conducted in person (preferably) and with no interruptions. If in person is not feasible, then an adobe connect session should suffice.</li>
		<li>If end-user is demoing PII data, ensure you are using Skype, instead of Adobe Connect.</li> 
		<li>Allotted timeframe for each user interview should be between 30-60 mins</li>
  		<li>Activity:
    			<ul>
				<li>Either the Designer or Product Manager moderates and leads the user interview, prompting questions based on the previously generated Popcorn Script.</li>
				<li>Ideally, you would want at least two to three note takers during the interview process in order to capture all key points from varying perspectives.</li>
				<li>The other attendees are writing down 1st person direct quotes. The reasoning behind this, is that during synthesis, the team will be converting the quotes into insights, generally in the 3rd person. </li>
				<li>There are various ways to do the note taking, some prefer post it notes, otherâ€™s may use word docs,  Kanban or GitHub boards. </li>
			</ul>
